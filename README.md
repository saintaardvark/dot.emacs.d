# dot.emacs.d

## Overview

This is my .emacs.d repository.

## Usage

Clone to .emacs.d, then run Emacs.  Packages should be installed by default.

## You should buy this book:

["Mastering Emacs" by Mickey
Peterson](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) is an absolutely amazing
book.  If you use Emacs in any way, you owe it to yourself to buy
it. Recommended without hesitation.
