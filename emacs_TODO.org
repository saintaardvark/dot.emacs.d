* TODO Add shell to projectile-commander methods
  - Replace current "s" to switch projects
* TODO Have x-hugh-hydra.el and x-hugh-keymap use same source for hydra keys
* TODO Why is grx being detected as make project instead of go?
  - Problem: C-c p 4 t from main.go does not open main_test.go;
    instead, says "projectile-find-implementation-or-test: No matching
    test file found for project type ‘make’"
  - [[file:.cask/26.1/elpa/projectile-20190126.1117/projectile.el::(projectile-register-project-type%20'go%20projectile-go-project-test-function][this function]] (er, custom var appears to show that it *should* be
    detectable -- just not sure why it's not
* TODO Error (use-package): filladapt/:catch: Loading ‘/Users/hubrown/.emacs.d/filladapt.el’: old-style backquotes detected!
* TODO Warning (initialization): Your ‘load-path’ seems to contain
  your ‘.emacs.d’ directory: ~/.emacs.d/
  This is likely to cause problems...
  Consider using a subdirectory instead, e.g.: /Users/hubrown/.emacs.d/lisp
* TODO Figure out how to turn on comment-auto-fill-only-comments again
  - If turn this on globally, then it ends up borking auto-fill-mode
    in Post-mode...but it's damn handy for nearly everything else
* TODO Add keyboard shortcut for delete-horizontal-space
* TODO File mode specification error: (error Autoloading file /Users/hubrown/.emacs.d/modes/post.el failed to define function post)
  - not sure where this is coming from. Looking for a hook or something that calls just "post", but not seeing anything.
* TODO Set custom file to /dev/null or some such
* TODO Figure out flashing matching parens script again
  - mic-paren
* TODO Stop helm from trying to autocomplete stuff at point
  - I very rarely want to email someone if point at an email address
  - ditto for hyperlink

  - Encountered this again [2020-03-20 Fri]
    - They're in the upstream repo, not sure why they're not here
    - Copied manually from my old laptop. :-(
* TODO Add visual-lines-mode to hydra if not there already
* TODO Add longlines-mode alias for visual-lines-mode
   I can never remember the new name...
* TODO Watch for fix for Inconsolata
  - https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata/issues/42
  - https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=39082
* TODO There's an Emacs 27? 28?
* TODO Turn off touchpad stuff in x-hugh-mouse.el
  - Trackpad on recent laptops is fine
  - Make a custom variable to enable it or not
* TODO See if Emacs can chord ctrl+space to replace that awful alt key on the MS keyboard
* TODO Try https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode
* TODO Shellcheck in emacs appears to assume posix shell rather than looking at shebang
  - Shellcheck in emacs will complain about Bashisms when shebang has them
  - Shellcheck run from shell will be fine about this
  - Is this configured somewhere?
* TODO https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda
* TODO Try out these ivy/counsel/swiper settings
  - Good intro: https://writequit.org/denver-emacs/presentations/2017-04-11-ivy.html
* TODO [#A] Emacs: delete trailing whitespace in file and update magit :emacs:
* TODO [#C] Keyboard shortcut for todo/today                          :emacs:
* TODO [#C] Keyboard shortcut for maximize/3xbigger                   :emacs:
* TODO [#C] Think about how journal and checkin to different org headlines could be integrated :emacs:
  - Example: I think of the journal as my easily searchable record of
    work.  If I check into another item (rather than just "Tuesday"),
    then I'd like that to show up in the journal -- a pointer to the
    original headline would be fine.
  - I'd also want to make sure the original headline contents would be
    available even if archived or deleted -- I don't want to lose
    history.  Some detail could be lost -- detailed notes would likely
    be less useful over time -- but i'd still want to know that I
    worked on Foo that day.
* TODO [#C] Have way of reverting the capitalization for doublecaps   :emacs:
* TODO [#C] Is there a way to run typescript calls from Emacs?        :emacs:
  - Could I run
    https://github.com/balena-io/open-balena-api/pull/356/files from
    it to test the API calls?
* TODO [#C] Save register a and make it persistent                    :emacs:
  - journal.org on left, agenda on right, certain level of zoom
* TODO https://github.com/cute-jumper/emacs-firefox-controller
