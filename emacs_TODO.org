CLOSED: [2023-07-15 Sat 12:10]
- No longer a problem as of now.
- Problem: C-c p 4 t from main.go does not open main_test.go;
  instead, says "projectile-find-implementation-or-test: No matching
  test file found for project type ‘make’"
- [[file:.cask/26.1/elpa/projectile-20190126.1117/projectile.el::(projectile-register-project-type%20'go%20projectile-go-project-test-function][this function]] (er, custom var appears to show that it *should* be

* DONE Warning (initialization): Your ‘load-path’ seems to contain
CLOSED: [2023-08-27 Sun 16:08]
your ‘.emacs.d’ directory: ~/.emacs.d/
This is likely to cause problems...
Consider using a subdirectory instead, e.g.: /Users/hubrown/.emacs.d/lisp

* TODO Have x-hugh-hydra.el and x-hugh-keymap use same source for hydra keys
If this was Python, I'd be doing:

#+begin_src python
  keymapping = { "a": hydra-apropos/body,
                 "d": hdyra-dev/body,
                }
#+end_src

...etc

Could do this with alists:

#+begin_src lisp
  ((pine . cones)
   (oak . acorns)
   (maple . seeds))

  (setq hydra_map '(("a" . hydra-apropos/body)
                    ("d" . hydra-dev/body)))

  ;; this is just to see how I could work with this
  (dolist (entry hydra_map value)
    (message (cdr (cdr hydra_map))))

  ;; Dash is also good
  (--map (message (car it)) hydra_map)
#+end_src

* TODO Shellcheck in emacs appears to assume posix shell rather than looking at shebang
- Shellcheck in emacs will complain about Bashisms when shebang has them
- Shellcheck run from shell will be fine about this
- Is this configured somewhere?

* TODO [#C] Think about how journal and checkin to different org headlines could be integrated :emacs:
- Example: I think of the journal as my easily searchable record of
  work.  If I check into another item (rather than just "Tuesday"),
  then I'd like that to show up in the journal -- a pointer to the
  original headline would be fine.
- I'd also want to make sure the original headline contents would be
  available even if archived or deleted -- I don't want to lose
  history.  Some detail could be lost -- detailed notes would likely
  be less useful over time -- but i'd still want to know that I
  worked on Foo that day.
